**coverforest** is a template project for [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org)
compatible extensions.

It aids development of estimators that can be used in scikit-learn pipelines and
(hyper)parameter search, while facilitating testing (including some API compliance),
documentation, open source development, packaging, and continuous integration.

Refer to the documentation to modify the template for your own scikit-learn
