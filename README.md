## 🌳 coverforest - Conformal Predictions with Random Forest

A simple and fast implementation of conformal random forests for both classification and regression tasks. **coverforest** extends [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org)'s random forest implementation to provide prediction sets/intervals with guaranteed coverage using conformal prediction methods.

**coverforest** provides three conformal prediction methods for random forests:
- CV+ (Cross-Validation+) [[1](#1), [2](#2)].
- Jackknife+-after-Bootstrap [[3]](#3).
- Split Conformal [[4]](#4).

The library provides two main classes: `CoverForestRegressor` for interval prediction and `CoverForestClassifier`. for set prediction.
Here are quick runs of the two classes:

```python
from coverforest import CoverForestRegressor

reg = CoverForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, method='bootstrap')  # using J+-a-Bootstrap
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred, y_intervals = reg.predict(X_test, alpha=0.05)             # 95% coverage intervals
```

```python
from coverforest import CoverForestClassifier

clf = CoverForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, method='cv')  # using CV+
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred, y_sets = clf.predict(X_test, alpha=0.05)            # 95% coverage sets
```

You can try these models in Colab: [[Classification](https://colab.research.google.com/github/donlapark/coverforest/blob/main/notebooks/classification_pipeline.ipynb)] [[Regression](https://colab.research.google.com/github/donlapark/coverforest/blob/main/notebooks/regression_pipeline.ipynb)]

For additional examples and package API, see [Documentation](https://donlapark.github.io/coverforest).

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python >=3.9
- Scikit-learn >=1.6.0

## ⚡ Installation

You can install **coverforest** using pip:

```bash
pip install coverforest
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/donlapark/coverforest.git
cd coverforest
pip install .
```

### Regularization in conformal set predictions

The classifier includes two regularization parameters $k$ and $\lambda$ that encourage smaller prediction sets [[5]](#5).

```python
clf = CoverForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, method='cv', k_init=2, lambda_init=0.1)
```

Automatic searching for suitable $k$ and $\lambda$ is also possible by specifying `k_init="auto"` and `lambda_init="auto"`, which are the default values of `CoverForestClassifier`.

### Performance Tips

Random forest leverages parallel computation by processing trees concurrently. Use the `n_jobs` parameter in `fit()` and `predict()` to control CPU usage (`n_jobs=-1` uses all cores).

For prediction, conformity score calculations require a memory array of size `(n_train × n_test × n_classes)`. To optimize performance with high `n_jobs` values, split large test sets into smaller batches.

See the documentation for more details and examples.
