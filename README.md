## 🌳 coverforest - Random Forest with Conformal Predictions

A fast and efficient implementation of conformal random forests for both classification and regression tasks. coverforest extends scikit-learn's random forest implementation to provide prediction sets/intervals with guaranteed coverage properties using conformal prediction methods.

coverforest provides three conformal prediction methods for random forests:
- CV+ (Cross-Validation+)[[1]](#1)
- Jackknife+-after-Bootstrap[[2]](#2)
- Split Conformal[[3]](#3)

The library provides two main classes: `CoverForestClassifier` and `CoverForestRegressor`.
Here are quick runs of the two classes:
```python
from coverforest import CoverForestClassifier

clf = CoverForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, method='cv')
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred, y_sets = clf.predict(X_test, alpha=0.05)  # 95% coverage sets
```

```python
from coverforest import CoverForestRegressor

reg = CoverForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, method='bootstrap')
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred, y_intervals = reg.predict(X_test, alpha=0.05)  # 95% coverage intervals
```

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python >=3.9
- Scikit-learn >=1.6.0

## ⚡ Installation

You can install coverforest using pip:

```bash
